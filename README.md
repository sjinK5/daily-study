# Daily Study Log


This repository is a personal study log.
I use it to consistently document what I learn while exploring
both frontend and backend development.

At the moment, I’m focusing on understanding core web fundamentals
using vanilla JavaScript, and gradually experimenting with
both frontend and backend concepts before deciding which path
to dive deeper into.

## Topics I’m exploring
- Web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Vanilla JavaScript (core concepts, DOM, async basics)
- Frontend fundamentals
- Backend fundamentals
- General programming concepts and problem-solving

The goal of this repository is not perfection,
but consistency and steady progress.
